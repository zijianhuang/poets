Poor Archy, whose owl-eyes are tempered to the error of his age, and because he is a fool, and by special ordinance of God forbidden ever to see himself as he is, sees now in that deep eye a blindfold devil sitting on the ball, and weighing words out between king and subjects. One scale is full of promises, and the other full of protestations: and then another devil creeps behind the first out of the dark windings [of a] pregnant lawyer's brain, and takes the bandage from the other's eyes, and throws a sword into the left-hand scale, for all the world like my Lord Essex's there.<br>Strafford.<br>A rod in pickle for the Fool's back!<br><br>Archy.<br><br>Ay, and some are now smiling whose tears will make the brine; for the Fool sees--<br>Strafford.<br><br>Insolent!

If all turncoats were whipped out of palaces, poor Archy would be disgraced in good company. Let the knaves whip the fools, and all the fools laugh at it. [Let the] wise and godly slit each other's noses and ears (having no need of any sense of discernment in their craft); and the knaves, to marshal them, join in a procession to Bedlam, to entreat the madmen to omit their sublime Platonic contemplations, and manage the state of England. Let all the honest men who lie [pinched?] up at the prisons or the pillories, in custody of the pursuivants of the High-Commission Court, marshal them.<br>Enter Secretary Lyttelton, with papers.<br><br>King<br>(looking over the papers).<br>These stiff Scots<br>His Grace of Canterbury must take order<br>To force under the Church's yoke.--You, Wentworth,<br>Shall be myself in Ireland, and shall add<br>Your wisdom, gentleness, and energy,<br>To what in me were wanting.--My Lord Weston,<br>Look that those merchants draw not without loss<br>Their bullion from the Tower; and, on the payment<br>Of shipmoney, take fullest compensation<br>For violation of our royal forests,<br>Whose limits, from neglect, have been o'ergrown<br>With cottages and cornfields. The uttermost<br>Farthing exact from those who claim exemption<br>From knighthood: that which once was a reward<br>Shall thus be made a punishment, that subjects<br>May know how majesty can wear at will<br>The rugged mood.--My Lord of Coventry,<br>Lay my command upon the Courts below<br>That bail be not accepted for the prisoners<br>Under the warrant of the Star Chamber.<br>The people shall not find the stubbornness<br>Of Parliament a cheap or easy method<br>Of dealing with their rightful sovereign:<br>And doubt not this, my Lord of Coventry,<br>We will find time and place for fit rebuke.--<br>My Lord of Canterbury.<br><br>Archy.<br>The fool is here.<br><br>Laud.<br>I crave permission of your Majesty<br>To order that this insolent fellow be<br>Chastised: he mocks the sacred character,<br>Scoffs at the state, and--<br><br>King.<br><br>What, my Archy?<br>He mocks and mimics all he sees and hears,<br>Yet with a quaint and graceful licence--Prithee<br>For this once do not as Prynne would, were he<br>Primate of England.

Subdue thy actions<br>Even to the disposition of thy purpose,<br>And be that tempered as the Ebro's steel;<br>And banish weak-eyed Mercy to the weak,<br>Whence she will greet thee with a gift of peace,<br>And not betray thee with a traitor's kiss,<br>As when she keeps the company of rebels,<br>Who think that she is Fear. This do, lest we<br>Should fall as from a glorious pinnacle<br>In a bright dream, and wake as from a dream<br>Out of our worshipped state.<br><br>King.<br>Belovèd friend,<br>God is my witness that this weight of power,<br>Which He sets me my earthly task to wield.<br>Under His law, is my delight and pride<br>Only because thou lovest that and me.<br>For a king bears the office of a God<br>To all the under world; and to his God<br>Alone he must deliver up his trust,<br>Unshorn of its permitted attributes.<br>[It seems] now as the baser elements<br>Had mutinied against the golden sun<br>That kindles them to harmony and quells<br>Their self-destroying rapine.

See those thronging chariots\nRolling, like painted clouds before the wind,\nBehind their solemn steeds: how some are shaped\nLike curved sea-shells dyed by the azure depths\nOf Indian seas; some like the new-born moon;\nAnd some like cars in which the Romans climbed\n(Canopied by Victory's eagle-wings outspread)\nThe Capitolian--See how gloriously\nThe mettled horses in the torchlight stir\nTheir gallant riders, while they check their pride,\nLike shapes of some diviner element\nThan English air, and beings nobler than\nThe envious and admiring multitude.\n\nSecond Citizen.\nAy, there they are--\nNobles, and sons of nobles, patentees,\nMonopolists, and stewards of this poor farm,\nOn whose lean sheep sit the prophetic crows,\nHere is the pomp that strips the houseless orphan,\nHere is the pride that breaks the desolate heart.\nThese are the lilies glorious as Solomon,\nWho toil not, neither do they spin,--unless\nIt be the webs they catch poor rogues withal.\nHere is the surfeit which to them who earn\nThe niggard wages of the earth, scarce leaves\nThe tithe that will support them till they crawl\nBack to her cold hard bosom. Here is health\nFollowed by grim disease, glory by shame,\nWaste by lame famine, wealth by squalid want,\nAnd England's sin by England's punishment.\nAnd, as the effect pursues the cause foregone,\nLo, giving substance to my words, behold\nAt once the sign and the thing signified--\nA troop of cripples, beggars, and lean outcasts,\nHorsed upon stumbling jades, carted with dung,\nDragged for a day from cellars and low cabins\nAnd rotten hiding-holes, to point the moral\nOf this presentment, and bring up the rear\nOf painted pomp with misery!\n\nThe Youth.\n'Tis but\nThe anti-masque, and serves as discords do\nIn sweetest music. Who would love May flowers\nIf they succeeded not to Winter's flaw;\nOr day unchanged by night; or joy itself\nWithout the touch of sorrow?\n\nSecond Citizen.\nI and thou--\n\nA Marshalsman.\nPlace, give place!\n\nScene II.\n--A Chamber in Whitehall. Enter the King, Queen, Laud, Lord Strafford, Lord\nCottington, and other Lords;Archy ; also St. John, with some Gentlemen of the\nInns of Court.\n\nKing.\nThanks, gentlemen. I heartily accept\nThis token of your service: your gay masque\nWas performed gallantly. And it shows well\nWhen subjects twine such flowers of [observance?]\nWith the sharp thorns that deck the English crown.\nA gentle heart enjoys what it confers,\nEven as it suffers that which it inflicts,\nThough Justice guides the stroke.\nAccept my hearty thanks.\n\nQueen.\nAnd gentlemen,\nCall your poor Queen your debtor. Your quaint pageant\nRose on me like the figures of past years,\nTreading their still path back to infancy,\nMore beautiful and mild as they draw nearer\nThe quiet cradle. I could have almost wept\nTo think I was in Paris, where these shows\nAre well devised--such as I was ere yet\nMy young heart shared a portion of the burthen,\nThe careful weight, of this great monarchy.\nThere, gentlemen, between the sovereign's pleasure\nAnd that which it regards, no clamour lifts\nIts proud interposition.\nIn Paris ribald censurers dare not move\nTheir poisonous tongues against these sinless sports;\nAnd his smile\nWarms those who bask in it, as ours would do\nIf . . . Take my heart's thanks: add them, gentlemen,\nTo those good words which, were he King of France,\nMy royal lord would turn to golden deeds.\n\nSt. John.\nMadam, the love of Englishmen can make\nThe lightest favour of their lawful king\nOutweigh a despot's.--We humbly take our leaves,\nEnriched by smiles which France can never buy.\n\n[Exeunt St. John and the Gentlemen of the Inns of Court.\n\nKing.\nMy Lord Archbishop,\nMark you what spirit sits in St. John's eyes?\nMethinks it is too saucy for this presence.\n\nArchy.\n\nYes, pray your Grace look: for, like an unsophisticated [eye] sees everything\nupside down, you who are wise will discern the shadow of an idiot in lawn\nsleeves and a rochet setting springes to catch woodcocks in haymaking time. Poor\nArchy, whose owl-eyes are tempered to the error of his age, and because he is a\nfool, and by special ordinance of God forbidden ever to see himself as he is,\nsees now in that deep eye a blindfold devil sitting on the ball, and weighing\nwords out between king and subjects. One scale is full of promises, and the\nother full of protestations: and then another devil creeps behind the first out\nof the dark windings [of a] pregnant lawyer's brain, and takes the bandage from\nthe other's eyes, and throws a sword into the left-hand scale, for all the world\nlike my Lord Essex's there.\nStrafford.\nA rod in pickle for the Fool's back!\n\nArchy.\n\nAy, and some are now smiling whose tears will make the brine; for the Fool\nsees--\nStrafford.\n\nInsolent! You shall have your coat turned and be whipped out of the palace for\nthis.\nArchy.\n\nWhen all the fools are whipped, and all the Protestant writers, while the knaves\nare whipping the fools ever since a thief was set to catch a thief. If all\nturncoats were whipped out of palaces, poor Archy would be disgraced in good\ncompany. Let the knaves whip the fools, and all the fools laugh at it. [Let the]\nwise and godly slit each other's noses and ears (having no need of any sense of\ndiscernment in their craft); and the knaves, to marshal them, join in a\nprocession to Bedlam, to entreat the madmen to omit their sublime Platonic\ncontemplations, and manage the state of England. Let all the honest men who lie\n[pinched?] up at the prisons or the pillories, in custody of the pursuivants of\nthe High-Commission Court, marshal them.\nEnter Secretary Lyttelton, with papers.\n\nKing\n(looking over the papers).\nThese stiff Scots\nHis Grace of Canterbury must take order\nTo force under the Church's yoke.--You, Wentworth,\nShall be myself in Ireland, and shall add\nYour wisdom, gentleness, and energy,\nTo what in me were wanting.--My Lord Weston,\nLook that those merchants draw not without loss\nTheir bullion from the Tower; and, on the payment\nOf shipmoney, take fullest compensation\nFor violation of our royal forests,\nWhose limits, from neglect, have been o'ergrown\nWith cottages and cornfields. The uttermost\nFarthing exact from those who claim exemption\nFrom knighthood: that which once was a reward\nShall thus be made a punishment, that subjects\nMay know how majesty can wear at will\nThe rugged mood.--My Lord of Coventry,\nLay my command upon the Courts below\nThat bail be not accepted for the prisoners\nUnder the warrant of the Star Chamber.\nThe people shall not find the stubbornness\nOf Parliament a cheap or easy method\nOf dealing with their rightful sovereign:\nAnd doubt not this, my Lord of Coventry,\nWe will find time and place for fit rebuke.--\nMy Lord of Canterbury.\n\nArchy.\nThe fool is here.\n\nLaud.\nI crave permission of your Majesty\nTo order that this insolent fellow be\nChastised: he mocks the sacred character,\nScoffs at the state, and--\n\nKing.\n\nWhat, my Archy?\nHe mocks and mimics all he sees and hears,\nYet with a quaint and graceful licence--Prithee\nFor this once do not as Prynne would, were he\nPrimate of England. With your Grace's leave,\nHe lives in his own world; and, like a parrot\nHung in his gilded prison from the window\nOf a queen's bower over the public way,\nBlasphemes with a bird's mind:--his words, like arrows\nWhich know no aim beyond the archer's wit,\nStrike sometimes what eludes philosophy.--\n(To Archy.)\nGo, sirrah, and repent of your offence\nTen minutes in the rain; be it your penance\nTo bring news how the world goes there.\n\n[Exit Archy.\n\nPoor Archy!\nHe weaves about himself a world of mirth\nOut of the wreck of ours.\n\nLaud.\nI take with patience, as my Master did,\nAll scoffs permitted from above.\n\nKing.\nMy lord,\nPray overlook these papers. Archy's words\nHad wings, but these have talons.\n\nQueen.\nAnd the lion\nThat wears them must be tamed. My dearest lord,\nI see the new-born courage in your eye\nArmed to strike dead the Spirit of the Time,\nWhich spurs to rage the many-headed beast.\nDo thou persist: for, faint but in resolve,\nAnd it were better thou hadst still remained\nThe slave of thine own slaves, who tear like curs\nThe fugitive, and flee from the pursuer;\nAnd Opportunity, that empty wolf,\nFlies at his throat who falls. Subdue thy actions\nEven to the disposition of thy purpose,\nAnd be that tempered as the Ebro's steel;\nAnd banish weak-eyed Mercy to the weak,\nWhence she will greet thee with a gift of peace,\nAnd not betray thee with a traitor's kiss,\nAs when she keeps the company of rebels,\nWho think that she is Fear. This do, lest we\nShould fall as from a glorious pinnacle\nIn a bright dream, and wake as from a dream\nOut of our worshipped state.\n\nKing.\nBelovèd friend,\nGod is my witness that this weight of power,\nWhich He sets me my earthly task to wield.\nUnder His law, is my delight and pride\nOnly because thou lovest that and me.\nFor a king bears the office of a God\nTo all the under world; and to his God\nAlone he must deliver up his trust,\nUnshorn of its permitted attributes.\n[It seems] now as the baser elements\nHad mutinied against the golden sun\nThat kindles them to harmony and quells\nTheir self-destroying rapine. The wild million\nStrike at the eye that guides them; like as humours\nOf the distempered body that conspire\nAgainst the spirit of life throned in the heart,--\nAnd thus become the prey of one another,\nAnd last of death--\n\nStrafford.\nThat which would be ambition in a subject\nIs duty in a sovereign; for on him,\nAs on a keystone, hangs the arch of life,\nWhose safety is its strength. Degree and form,\nAnd all that makes the age of reasoning man\nMore memorable than a beast's, depend on this--\nThat Right should fence itself inviolably\nWith Power; in which respect the state of England\nFrom usurpation by the insolent commons\nCries for reform.\nGet treason, and spare treasure. Fee with coin\nThe loudest murmurers; feed with jealousies\nOpposing factions,--be thyself of none;\nAnd borrow gold of many, for those who lend\nWill serve thee till thou payest them; and thus\nKeep the fierce spirit of the hour at bay,\nTill time, and its coming generations\nOf nights and days unborn, bring some one chance,. . .\nOr war or pestilence or Nature's self,--\nBy some distemperature or terrible sign,\nBe as an arbiter betwixt themselves.\n. . . Nor let your Majesty\nDoubt here the peril of the unseen event.\nHow did your brother Kings, coheritors\nIn your high interest in the subject earth,\nRise past such troubles to that height of power\nWhere now they sit, and awfully serene\nSmile on the trembling world? Such popular storms\nPhilip the Second of Spain, this Lewis of France,\nAnd late the German head of many bodies,\nAnd every petty lord of Italy,\nQuelled or by arts or arms. Is England poorer\nOr feebler? or art thou who wield'st her power\nTamer than they? or shall this island be--\n[Girdled] by its inviolable waters--\nTo the world present and the world to come\nSole pattern of extinguished monarchy?\nNot if thou dost as I would have thee do.\n\nKing.\nYour words shall be my deeds:\nYou speak the image of my thought. My friend\n(If Kings can have a friend, I call thee so),\nBeyond the large commission which [belongs]\nUnder the great seal of the realm, take this:\nAnd, for some obvious reasons, let there be\nNo seal on it, except my kingly word\nAnd honour as I am a gentleman.\nBe--as thou art within my heart and mind--\nAnother self, here and in Ireland:\nDo what thou judgest well, take amplest licence,\nAnd stick not even at questionable means.\nHear me, Wentworth. My word is as a wall\nBetween thee and this world thine enemy--\nThat hates thee, for thou lovest me.\n\nStrafford.\nI own\nNo friend but thee, no enemies but thine:\nThy lightest thought is my eternal law.\nHow weak, how short, is life to pay--\n\nKing.\n\nPeace, peace.\nThou ow'st me nothing yet.\n\n(To Laud.)\nMy lord, what say\nThose papers?\n\nLaud.\nYour Majesty has ever interposed,\nIn lenity towards your native soil,\nBetween the heavy vengeance of the Church\nAnd Scotland. Mark the consequence of warming\nThis brood of northern vipers in your bosom.\nThe rabble, instructed no doubt\nBy Loudon, Lindsay, Hume, and false Argyll\n(For the waves never menace heaven until\nScourged by the wind's invisible tyranny),\nHave in the very temple of the Lord\nDone outrage to His chosen ministers.\nThey scorn the liturgy of the Holy Church,\nRefuse to obey her canons, and deny\nThe apostolic power with which the Spirit\nHas filled its elect vessels, even from him\nWho held the keys with power to loose and bind,\nTo him who now pleads in this royal presence.--\nLet ample powers and new instructions be\nSent to the High Commissioners in Scotland.\nTo death, imprisonment, and confiscation,\nAdd torture, add the ruin of the kindred\nOf the offender, add the brand of infamy,\nAdd mutilation: and if this suffice not,\nUnleash the sword and fire, that in their thirst\nThey may lick up that scum of schismatics.\nI laugh at those weak rebels who, desiring\nWhat we possess, still prate of Christian peace,\nAs if those dreadful arbitrating messengers\nWhich play the part of God 'twixt right and wrong,\nShould be let loose against the innocent sleep\nOf templed cities and the smiling fields,\nFor some poor argument of policy\nWhich touches our own profit or our pride\n(Where it indeed were Christian charity\nTo turn the cheek even to the smiter's hand):\nAnd, when our great Redeemer, when our God,\nWhen He who gave, accepted, and retained\nHimself in propitiation of our sins,\nIs scorned in His immediate ministry,\nWith hazard of the inestimable loss\nOf all the truth and discipline which is\nSalvation to the extremest generation\nOf men innumerable, they talk of peace!\nSuch peace as Canaan found, let Scotland now:\nFor, by that Christ who came to bring a sword,\nNot peace, upon the earth, and gave command\nTo His disciples at the Passover\nThat each should sell his robe and buy a sword,--\nOnce strip that minister of naked wrath,\nAnd it shall never sleep in peace again\nTill Scotland bend or break.\n\nKing.\nMy Lord Archbishop,\nDo what thou wilt and what thou canst in this.\nThy earthly even as thy heavenly King\nGives thee large power in his unquiet realm.\nBut we want money, and my mind misgives me\nThat for so great an enterprise, as yet,\nWe are unfurnished.\n\nStrafford.\nYet it may not long\nRest on our wills.\n\nCottington.\nThe expenses\nOf gathering shipmoney, and of distraining\nFor every petty rate (for we encounter\nA desperate opposition inch by inch\nIn every warehouse and on every farm),\nHave swallowed up the gross sum of the imposts;\nSo that, though felt as a most grievous scourge\nUpon the land, they stand us in small stead\nAs touches the receipt.\n\nStrafford.\n'Tis a conclusion\nMost arithmetical: and thence you infer\nPerhaps the assembling of a parliament.\nNow, if a man should call his dearest enemies\nTo sit in licensed judgement on his life,\nHis Majesty might wisely take that course. [Aside to Cottington.\nIt is enough to expect from these lean imposts\nThat they perform the office of a scourge,\nWithout more profit. (Aloud.)\nFines and confiscations,\nAnd a forced loan from the refractory city,\nWill fill our coffers: and the golden love\nOf loyal gentlemen and noble friends\nFor the worshipped father of our common country,\nWith contributions from the catholics,\nWill make Rebellion pale in our excess.\nBe these the expedients until time and wisdom\nShall frame a settled state of government.\n\nLaud.\nAnd weak expedients they! Have we not drained\nAll, till the . . . which seemed\nA mine exhaustless?\n\nStrafford.\nAnd the love which is,\nIf loyal hearts could turn their blood to gold.\n\nLaud.\nBoth now grow barren: and I speak it not\nAs loving parliaments, which, as they have been\nIn the right hand of bold bad mighty kings\nThe scourges of the bleeding Church, I hate.\nMethinks they scarcely can deserve our fear.\n\nStrafford.\nOh! my dear liege, take back the wealth thou gavest:\nWith that, take all I held, but as in trust\nFor thee, of mine inheritance: leave me but\nThis unprovided body for thy service,\nAnd a mind dedicated to no care\nExcept thy safety:--but assemble not\nA parliament. Hundreds will bring, like me,\nTheir fortunes, as they would their blood, before--\n\nKing.\nNo! thou who judgest them art but one. Alas!\nWe should be too much out of love with Heaven,\nDid this vile world show many such as thee,\nThou perfect, just, and honourable man!\nNever shall it be said that Charles of England\nStripped those he loved for fear of those he scorns;\nNor will he so much misbecome his throne\nAs to impoverish those who most adorn\nAnd best defend it. That you urge, dear Strafford,\nInclines me rather--\n\nQueen.\nTo a parliament?\nIs this thy firmness? and thou wilt preside\nOver a knot of . . . censurers,\nTo the unswearing of thy best resolves,\nAnd choose the worst, when the worst comes too soon?\nPlight not the worst before the worst must come.\nOh, wilt thou smile whilst our ribald foes,\nDressed in their own usurped authority,\nSharpen their tongues on Henrietta's fame?\nIt is enough! Thou lovest me no more!\n\n[Weeps.\n\nKing.\nOh, Henrietta!\n\n[They talk apart.\n\nCottington\n(to Laud).\nMoney we have none:\nAnd all the expedients of my Lord of Strafford\nWill scarcely meet the arrears.\n\nLaud.\nWithout delay\nAn army must be sent into the north;\nFollowed by a Commission of the Church,\nWith amplest power to quench in fire and blood,\nAnd tears and terror, and the pity of hell,\nThe intenser wrath of Heresy. God will give\nVictory; and victory over Scotland give\nThe lion England tamed into our hands.\nThat will lend power, and power bring gold.\n\nCottington.\nMeanwhile\nWe must begin first where your Grace leaves off.\nGold must give power, or--\n\nLaud.\nI am not averse\nFrom the assembling of a parliament.\nStrong actions and smooth words might teach them soon\nThe lesson to obey. And are they not\nA bubble fashioned by the monarch's mouth,\nThe birth of one light breath? If they serve no purpose,\nA word dissolves them.\n\nStrafford.\nThe engine of parliaments\nMight be deferred until I can bring over\nThe Irish regiments: they will serve to assure\nThe issue of the war against the Scots.\nAnd, this game won--which if lost, all is lost--\nGather these chosen leaders of the rebels,\nAnd call them, if you will, a parliament.\n\nKing.\nOh, be our feet still tardy to shed blood,\nGuilty though it may be! I would still spare\nThe stubborn country of my birth, and ward\nFrom countenances which I loved in youth\nThe wrathful Church's lacerating hand.\n(To Laud.)\nHave you o'erlooked the other articles?\n\n[Re-enter Archy.\n\nLaud.\nHazlerig, Hampden, Pym, young Harry Vane,\nCromwell, and other rebels of less note,\nIntend to sail with the next favouring wind\nFor the Plantations.\n\nArchy.\nWhere they think to found\nA commonwealth like Gonzalo's in the play,\nGynaecocoenic and pantisocratic.\n\nKing.\nWhat's that, sirrah?\n\nArchy.\nNew devil's politics.\nHell is the pattern of all commonwealths:\nLucifer was the first republican.\nWill you hear Merlin's prophecy, how three [posts?]\n'In one brainless skull, when the whitethorn is full,\nShall sail round the world, and come back again:\nShall sail round the world in a brainless skull,\nAnd come back again when the moon is at full:'--\nWhen, in spite of the Church,\nThey will hear homilies of whatever length\nOr form they please.\n\n[Cottington?]\nSo please your Majesty to sign this order\nFor their detention.\n\nArchy.\n\nIf your Majesty were tormented night and day by fever, gout, rheumatism, and\nstone, and asthma, etc., and you found these diseases had secretly entered into\na conspiracy to abandon you, should you think it necessary to lay an embargo on\nthe port by which they meant to dispeople your unquiet kingdom of man?\nKing.\n\nIf fear were made for kings, the Fool mocks wisely; But in this case--(writing)\n. Here, my lord, take the warrant, And see it duly executed forthwith.--\nThat imp of malice and mockery shall be punished.\n[Exeunt all but King, Queen, and Archy.\n\nArchy.\n\nAy, I am the physician of whom Plato prophesied, who was to be accused by the\nconfectioner before a jury of children, who found him guilty without waiting for\nthe summing-up, and hanged him without benefit of clergy. Thus Baby Charles, and\nthe Twelfth-night Queen of Hearts, and the overgrown schoolboy Cottington, and\nthat little urchin Laud-- who would reduce a verdict of 'guilty, death,' by\nfamine, if it were impregnable by composition--all impannelled against poor\nArchy for presenting them bitter physic the last day of the holidays.\nQueen.\nIs the rain over, sirrah?\n\nKing.\nWhen it rains\nAnd the sun shines, 'twill rain again to-morrow:\nAnd therefore never smile till you've done crying.\n\nArchy.\n\nBut 'tis all over now: like the April anger of woman, the gentle sky has wept\nitself serene.\nQueen.\n\nWhat news abroad? how looks the world this morning?\nArchy.\n\nGloriously as a grave covered with virgin flowers. There's a rainbow in the sky.\nLet your Majesty look at it, for\n'A rainbow in the morning\nIs the shepherd's warning;'\n\nand the flocks of which you are the pastor are scattered among the\nmountain-tops, where every drop of water is a flake of snow, and the breath of\nMay pierces like a January blast.\nKing.\n\nThe sheep have mistaken the wolf for their shepherd, my poor boy; and the\nshepherd, the wolves for their watchdogs.\nQueen.\n\nBut the rainbow was a good sign, Archy: it says that the waters of the deluge\nare gone, and can return no more.\nArchy.\n\nAy, the salt-water one: but that of tears and blood must yet come down, and that\nof fire follow, if there be any truth in lies.--The rainbow hung over the city\nwith all its shops, . . . and churches, from north to south, like a bridge of\ncongregated lightning pieced by the masonry of heaven-- like a balance in which\nthe angel that distributes the coming hour was weighing that heavy one whose\npoise is now felt in the lightest hearts, before it bows the proudest heads\nunder the meanest feet.\nQueen.\n\nWho taught you this trash, sirrah?\nArchy.\n\nA torn leaf out of an old book trampled in the dirt. --But for the rainbow. It\nmoved as the sun moved, and . . . until the top of the Tower . . . of a cloud\nthrough its left-hand tip, and Lambeth Palace look as dark as a rock before the\nother. Methought I saw a crown figured upon one tip, and a mitre on the other.\nSo, as I had heard treasures were found where the rainbow quenches its points\nupon the earth, I set off, and at the Tower--But I shall not tell your Majesty\nwhat I found close to the closet-window on which the rainbow had glimmered.\nKing.\n\nSpeak: I will make my Fool my conscience.\nArchy.\n\nThen conscience is a fool.--I saw there a cat caught in a rat-trap. I heard the\nrats squeak behind the wainscots: it seemed to me that the very mice were\nconsulting on the manner of her death.\nQueen.\n\nArchy is shrewd and bitter.\nArchy.\n\nLike the season, So blow the winds.--But at the other end of the rainbow, where\nthe gray rain was tempered along the grass and leaves by a tender interfusion of\nviolet and gold in the meadows beyond Lambeth, what think you that I found\ninstead of a mitre?\nKing.\n\nVane's wits perhaps.\nArchy.\n\nSomething as vain. I saw a gross vapour hovering in a stinking ditch over the\ncarcass of a dead ass, some rotten rags, and broken dishes--the wrecks of what\nonce administered to the stuffing-out and the ornament of a worm of worms. His\nGrace of Canterbury expects to enter the New Jerusalem some Palm Sunday in\ntriumph on the ghost of this ass.\nQueen.\nEnough, enough! Go desire Lady Jane\nShe place my lute, together with the music\nMari received last week from Italy,\nIn my boudoir, and--\n\n[Exit Archy.\n\nKing.\nI'll go in.\n\nQueen.\nMy beloved lord,\nHave you not noted that the Fool of late\nHas lost his careless mirth, and that his words\nSound like the echoes of our saddest fears?\nWhat can it mean? I should be loth to think\nSome factious slave had tutored him.\n\nKing.\nOh, no!\nHe is but Occasion's pupil. Partly 'tis\nThat our minds piece the vacant intervals\nOf his wild words with their own fashioning,--\nAs in the imagery of summer clouds,\nOr coals of the winter fire, idlers find\nThe perfect shadows of their teeming thoughts:\nAnd partly, that the terrors of the time\nAre sown by wandering Rumour in all spirits;\nAnd in the lightest and the least, may best\nBe seen the current of the coming wind.\n\nQueen.\nYour brain is overwrought with these deep thoughts.\nCome, I will sing to you; let us go try\nThese airs from Italy; and, as we pass\nThe gallery, we'll decide where that Correggio\nShall hang--the Virgin Mother\nWith her child, born the King of heaven and earth,\nWhose reign is men's salvation. And you shall see\nA cradled miniature of yourself asleep,\nStamped on the heart by never-erring love;\nLiker than any Vandyke ever made,\nA pattern to the unborn age of thee,\nOver whose sweet beauty I have wept for joy\nA thousand times, and now should weep for sorrow,\nDid I not think that after we were dead\nOur fortunes would spring high in him, and that\nThe cares we waste upon our heavy crown\nWould make it light and glorious as a wreath\nOf Heaven's beams for his dear innocent brow.\n\nKing.\nDear Henrietta!\n\nScene III.\n--The Star Chamber.

name\nEchoing from the cave of Fame.\n\n'For the labourer thou art bread,\nAnd a comely table spread\nFrom his daily labour come\nIn a neat and happy home.\n\n'Thou art clothes, and fire, and food\nFor the trampled multitude--\nNo--in countries that are free\nSuch starvation cannot be\nAs in England now we see.\n\n'To the rich thou art a check,\nWhen his foot is on the neck\nOf his victim, thou dost make\nThat he treads upon a snake.\n\n'Thou art Justice--ne'er for gold\nMay thy righteous laws be sold\nAs laws are in England--thou\nShield'st alike the high and low.\n\n'Thou art Wisdom--Freemen never\nDream that God will damn for ever\nAll who think those things untrue\nOf which Priests make such ado.\n\n'Thou art Peace--never by thee\nWould blood and treasure wasted be\nAs tyrants wasted them, when all\nLeagued to quench thy flame in Gaul.\n\n'What if English toil and blood\nWas poured forth, even as a flood?\nIt availed, Oh, Liberty,\nTo dim, but not extinguish thee.\n\n'Thou art Love--the rich have kissed\nThy feet, and like him following Christ,\nGive their substance to the free\nAnd through the rough world follow thee,\n\n'Or turn their wealth to arms, and make\nWar for thy belovèd sake\nOn wealth, and war, and fraud--whence they\nDrew the power which is their prey.\n\n'Science, Poetry, and Thought\nAre thy lamps; they make the lot\nOf the dwellers in a cot\nSo serene, they curse it not.\n\n'Spirit, Patience, Gentleness,\nAll that can adorn and bless\nArt thou--let deeds, not words, express\nThine exceeding loveliness.\n\n'Let a great Assembly be\nOf the fearless and the free\nOn some spot of English ground\nWhere the plains stretch wide around.\n\n'Let the blue sky overhead,\nThe green earth on which ye tread,\nAll that must eternal be\nWitness the solemnity.\n\n'From the corners uttermost\nOf the bounds of English coast;\nFrom every hut, village, and town\nWhere those who live and suffer moan\nFor others' misery or their own[2],\n\n'From the workhouse and the prison\nWhere pale as corpses newly risen,\nWomen, children, young and old\nGroan for pain, and weep for cold--\n\n'From the haunts of daily life\nWhere is waged the daily strife\nWith common wants and common cares\nWhich sows the human heart with tares--\n\n'Lastly from the palaces\nWhere the murmur of distress\nEchoes, like the distant sound\nOf a wind alive around\n\n'Those prison halls of wealth and fashion,\nWhere some few feel such compassion\nFor those who groan, and toil, and wail\nAs must make their brethren pale--\n\n'Ye who suffer woes untold,\nOr to feel, or to behold\nYour lost country bought and sold\nWith a price of blood and gold--\n\n'Let a vast assembly be,\nAnd with great solemnity\nDeclare with measured words that ye\nAre, as God has made ye, free--\n\n'Be your strong and simple words\nKeen to wound as sharpened swords,\nAnd wide as targes let them be,\nWith their shade to cover ye.\n\n'Let the tyrants pour around\nWith a quick and startling sound,\nLike the loosening of a sea,\nTroops of armed emblazonry.\n\n'Let the charged artillery drive\nTill the dead air seems alive\nWith the clash of clanging wheels,\nAnd the tramp of horses' heels.\n\n'Let the fixèd bayonet\nGleam with sharp desire to wet\nIts bright point in English blood\nLooking keen as one for food.\n\n'Let the horsemen's scimitars\nWheel and flash, like sphereless stars\nThirsting to eclipse their burning\nIn a sea of death and mourning.\n\n'Stand ye calm and resolute,\nLike a forest close and mute,\nWith folded arms and looks which are\nWeapons of unvanquished war,\n\n'And let Panic, who outspeeds\nThe career of armèd steeds\nPass, a disregarded shade\nThrough your phalanx undismayed.\n\n'Let the laws of your own land,\nGood or ill, between ye stand\nHand to hand, and foot to foot,\nArbiters of the dispute,\n\n'The old laws of England--they\nWhose reverend heads with age are gray,\nChildren of a wiser day;\nAnd whose solemn voice must be\nThine own echo--Liberty!\n\n'On those who first should violate\nSuch sacred heralds in their state\nRest the blood that must ensue,\nAnd it will not rest on you.\n\n'And if then the tyrants dare\nLet them ride among you there,\nSlash, and stab, and maim, and hew,--\nWhat they like, that let them do.\n\n'With folded arms and steady eyes,\nAnd little fear, and less surprise,\nLook upon them as they slay\nTill their rage has died away.\n\n'Then they will return with shame\nTo the place from which they came,\nAnd the blood thus shed will speak\nIn hot blushes on their cheek.\n\n'Every woman in the land\nWill point at them as they stand--\nThey will hardly dare to greet\nTheir acquaintance in the street.\n\n'And the bold, true warriors\nWho have hugged Danger in wars\nWill turn to those who would be free,\nAshamed of such base company.\n\n'And that slaughter to the Nation\nShall steam up like inspiration,\nEloquent, oracular;\nA volcano heard afar.\n\n'And these words shall then become\nLike Oppression's thundered doom\nRinging through each heart and brain,\nHeard again--again--again--\n\n'Rise like Lions after slumber\nIn unvanquishable number--\nShake your chains to earth like dew\nWhich in sleep had fallen on you--\nYe are many--they are few.'","bodyType":1,"created":"2022-09-05T07:42:35.6955386","modified":"2022-09-05T07:42:35.6955388","published":"0001-01-01","albumIds":[],"tagIds":[],"annotationIds":[],"numberedAnnotationBriefs":[],"pictureIds":[],"numberOfStanza":1},{"id":"acf624f3-90af-4096-8384-fcea7919f3db","title":"A

I arose &amp; for a space<br>The scene of woods &amp; waters seemed to keep,<br>\"Though it was now broad day, a gentle trace<br>Of light diviner than the common Sun<br>Sheds on the common Earth, but all the place<br>\"Was filled with many sounds woven into one<br>Oblivious melody, confusing sense<br>Amid the gliding waves &amp; shadows dun;<br>\"And as I looked the bright omnipresence<br>Of morning through the orient cavern flowed,<br>And the Sun's image radiantly intense<br>\"Burned on the waters of the well that glowed<br>Like gold, and threaded all the forest maze<br>With winding paths of emerald fire--there stood<br>\"Amid the sun, as he amid the blaze<br>Of his own glory, on the vibrating<br>Floor of the fountain, paved with flashing rays,<br>\"A shape all light, which with one hand did fling<br>Dew on the earth, as if she were the Dawn<br>Whose invisible rain forever seemed to sing<br>\"A silver music on the mossy lawn,<br>And still before her on the dusky grass<br>Iris her many coloured scarf had drawn.--<br>\"In her right hand she bore a crystal glass<br>Mantling with bright Nepenthe;--the fierce splendour<br>Fell from her as she moved under the mass<br>\"Of the deep cavern, &amp; with palms so tender<br>Their tread broke not the mirror of its billow,<br>Glided along the river, and did bend her<br>\"Head under the dark boughs, till like a willow<br>Her fair hair swept the bosom of the stream<br>That whispered with delight to be their pillow.--<br>\"As one enamoured is upborne in dream<br>O'er lily-paven lakes mid silver mist<br>To wondrous music, so this shape might seem<br>\"Partly to tread the waves with feet which kist<br>The dancing foam, partly to glide along<br>The airs that roughened the moist amethyst,<br>\"Or the slant morning beams that fell among<br>The trees, or the soft shadows of the trees;<br>And her feet ever to the ceaseless song<br>\"Of leaves &amp; winds &amp; waves &amp; birds &amp; bees<br>And falling drops moved in a measure new<br>Yet sweet, as on the summer evening breeze<br>\"Up from the lake a shape of golden dew<br>Between two rocks, athwart the rising moon,<br>Moves up the east, where eagle never flew.--<br>\"And still her feet, no less than the sweet tune<br>To which they moved, seemed as they moved, to blot<br>The thoughts of him who gazed on them, &amp; soon<br>\"All that was seemed as if it had been not,<br>As if the gazer's mind was strewn beneath<br>Her feet like embers, &amp; she, thought by thought,<br>\"Trampled its fires into the dust of death,<br>As Day upon the threshold of the east<br>Treads out the lamps of night, until the breath<br>\"Of darkness reillumines even the least<br>Of heaven's living eyes--like day she came,<br>Making the night a dream;

behind me rose the day; the Deep\nWas at my feet, & Heaven above my head\nWhen a strange trance over my fancy grew\nWhich was not slumber, for the shade it spread\nWas so transparent that the scene came through\nAs clear as when a veil of light is drawn\nO'er evening hills they glimmer; and I knew\nThat I had felt the freshness of that dawn,\nBathed in the same cold dew my brow & hair\nAnd sate as thus upon that slope of lawn\nUnder the self same bough, & heard as there\nThe birds, the fountains & the Ocean hold\nSweet talk in music through the enamoured air.\nAnd then a Vision on my brain was rolled.\n\nAs in that trance of wondrous thought I lay\nThis was the tenour of my waking dream.\nMethought I sate beside a public way\nThick strewn with summer dust, & a great stream\nOf people there was hurrying to & fro\nNumerous as gnats upon the evening gleam,\nAll hastening onward, yet none seemed to know\nWhither he went, or whence he came, or why\nHe made one of the multitude, yet so\nWas borne amid the crowd as through the sky\nOne of the million leaves of summer's bier.--\nOld age & youth, manhood & infancy,\nMixed in one mighty torrent did appear,\nSome flying from the thing they feared & some\nSeeking the object of another's fear,\nAnd others as with steps towards the tomb\nPored on the trodden worms that crawled beneath,\nAnd others mournfully within the gloom\nOf their own shadow walked, and called it death ...\nAnd some fled from it as it were a ghost,\nHalf fainting in the affliction of vain breath.\nBut more with motions which each other crost\nPursued or shunned the shadows the clouds threw\nOr birds within the noonday ether lost,\nUpon that path where flowers never grew;\nAnd weary with vain toil & faint for thirst\nHeard not the fountains whose melodious dew\nOut of their mossy cells forever burst\nNor felt the breeze which from the forest told\nOf grassy paths, & wood lawns interspersed\nWith overarching elms & caverns cold,\nAnd violet banks where sweet dreams brood, but they\nPursued their serious folly as of old ....\nAnd as I gazed methought that in the way\nThe throng grew wilder, as the woods of June\nWhen the South wind shakes the extinguished day.--\nAnd a cold glare, intenser than the noon\nBut icy cold, obscured with [[blank]] light\nThe Sun as he the stars. Like the young moon\nWhen on the sunlit limits of the night\nHer white shell trembles amid crimson air\nAnd whilst the sleeping tempest gathers might\nDoth, as a herald of its coming, bear\nThe ghost of her dead Mother, whose dim form\nBends in dark ether from her infant's chair,\nSo came a chariot on the silent storm\nOf its own rushing splendour, and a Shape\nSo sate within as one whom years deform\nBeneath a dusky hood & double cape\nCrouching within the shadow of a tomb,\nAnd o'er what seemed the head, a cloud like crape,\nWas bent a dun & faint etherial gloom\nTempering the light; upon the chariot's beam\nA Janus-visaged Shadow did assume\nThe guidance of that wonder-winged team.\nThe Shapes which drew it in thick lightnings\nWere lost: I heard alone on the air's soft stream\nThe music of their ever moving wings.\nAll the four faces of that charioteer\nHad their eyes banded . . . little profit brings\nSpeed in the van & blindness in the rear,\nNor then avail the beams that quench the Sun\nOr that his banded eyes could pierce the sphere\nOf all that is, has been, or will be done.--\nSo ill was the car guided, but it past\nWith solemn speed majestically on . . .\nThe crowd gave way, & I arose aghast,\nOr seemed to rise, so mighty was the trance,\nAnd saw like clouds upon the thunder blast\nThe million with fierce song and maniac dance\nRaging around; such seemed the jubilee\nAs when to greet some conqueror's advance\nImperial Rome poured forth her living sea\nFrom senatehouse & prison & theatre\nWhen Freedom left those who upon the free\nHad bound a yoke which soon they stooped to bear.\nNor wanted here the true similitude\nOf a triumphal pageant, for where'er\nThe chariot rolled a captive multitude\nWas driven; althose who had grown old in power\nOr misery,--all who have their age subdued,\nBy action or by suffering, and whose hour\nWas drained to its last sand in weal or woe,\nSo that the trunk survived both fruit & flower;\nAll those whose fame or infamy must grow\nTill the great winter lay the form & name\nOf their own earth with them forever low,\nAll but the sacred few who could not tame\nTheir spirits to the Conqueror, but as soon\nAs they had touched the world with living flame\nFled back like eagles to their native noon,\nOf those who put aside the diadem\nOf earthly thrones or gems, till the last one\nWere there;--for they of Athens & Jerusalem\nWere neither mid the mighty captives seen\nNor mid the ribald crowd that followed them\nOr fled before . . Now swift, fierce & obscene\nThe wild dance maddens in the van, & those\nWho lead it, fleet as shadows on the green,\nOutspeed the chariot & without repose\nMix with each other in tempestuous measure\nTo savage music .... Wilder as it grows,\nThey, tortured by the agonizing pleasure,\nConvulsed & on the rapid whirlwinds spun\nOf that fierce spirit, whose unholy leisure\nWas soothed by mischief since the world begun,\nThrow back their heads & loose their streaming hair,\nAnd in their dance round her who dims the Sun\nMaidens & youths fling their wild arms in air\nAs their feet twinkle; they recede, and now\nBending within each other's atmosphere\nKindle invisibly; and as they glow\nLike moths by light attracted & repelled,\nOft to new bright destruction come & go.\nTill like two clouds into one vale impelled\nThat shake the mountains when their lightnings mingle\nAnd die in rain,--the fiery band which held\nTheir natures, snaps . . . ere the shock cease to tingle\nOne falls and then another in the path\nSenseless, nor is the desolation single,\nYet ere I can say where the chariot hath\nPast over them; nor other trace I find\nBut as of foam after the Ocean's wrath\nIs spent upon the desert shore.--Behind,\nOld men, and women foully disarrayed\nShake their grey hair in the insulting wind,\nLimp in the dance & strain, with limbs decayed,\nSeeking to reach the light which leaves them still\nFarther behind & deeper in the shade.\nBut not the less with impotence of will\nThey wheel, though ghastly shadows interpose\nRound them & round each other, and fulfill\nTheir work and to the dust whence they arose\nSink & corruption veils them as they lie\nAnd frost in these performs what fire in those.\nStruck to the heart by this sad pageantry,\nHalf to myself I said, \"And what is this?\nWhose shape is that within the car? & why\"-\nI would have added--\"is all here amiss?\"\nBut a voice answered . . \"Life\" . . . I turned & knew\n(O Heaven have mercy on such wretchedness!)\nThat what I thought was an old root which grew\nTo strange distortion out of the hill side\nWas indeed one of that deluded crew,\nAnd that the grass which methought hung so wide\nAnd white, was but his thin discoloured hair,\nAnd that the holes it vainly sought to hide\nWere or had been eyes.--\"lf thou canst forbear\nTo join the dance, which I had well forborne,\"\nSaid the grim Feature, of my thought aware,\n\"I will now tell that which to this deep scorn\nLed me & my companions, and relate\nThe progress of the pageant since the morn;\n\"If thirst of knowledge doth not thus abate,\nFollow it even to the night, but I\nAm weary\" . . .

In the April prime\nWhen all the forest tops began to burn\n\"With kindling green, touched by the azure clime\nOf the young year, I found myself asleep\nUnder a mountain which from unknown time\n\"Had yawned into a cavern high & deep,\nAnd from it came a gentle rivulet\nWhose water like clear air in its calm sweep\n\"Bent the soft grass & kept for ever wet\nThe stems of the sweet flowers, and filled the grove\nWith sound which all who hear must needs forget\n\"All pleasure & all pain, all hate & love,\nWhich they had known before that hour of rest:\nA sleeping mother then would dream not of\n\"The only child who died upon her breast\nAt eventide, a king would mourn no more\nThe crown of which his brow was dispossest\n\"When the sun lingered o'er the Ocean floor\nTo gild his rival's new prosperity.--\nThou wouldst forget thus vainly to deplore\n\"Ills, which if ills, can find no cure from thee,\nThe thought of which no other sleep will quell\nNor other music blot from memory--\n\"So sweet & deep is the oblivious spell.--\nWhether my life had been before that sleep\nThe Heaven which I imagine, or a Hell\n\"Like this harsh world in which I wake to weep,\nI know not. I arose & for a space\nThe scene of woods & waters seemed to keep,\n\"Though it was now broad day, a gentle trace\nOf light diviner than the common Sun\nSheds on the common Earth, but all the place\n\"Was filled with many sounds woven into one\nOblivious melody, confusing sense\nAmid the gliding waves & shadows dun;\n\"And as I looked the bright omnipresence\nOf morning through the orient cavern flowed,\nAnd the Sun's image radiantly intense\n\"Burned on the waters of the well that glowed\nLike gold, and threaded all the forest maze\nWith winding paths of emerald fire--there stood\n\"Amid the sun, as he amid the blaze\nOf his own glory, on the vibrating\nFloor of the fountain, paved with flashing rays,\n\"A shape all light, which with one hand did fling\nDew on the earth, as if she were the Dawn\nWhose invisible rain forever seemed to sing\n\"A silver music on the mossy lawn,\nAnd still before her on the dusky grass\nIris her many coloured scarf had drawn.--\n\"In her right hand she bore a crystal glass\nMantling with bright Nepenthe;--the fierce splendour\nFell from her as she moved under the mass\n\"Of the deep cavern, & with palms so tender\nTheir tread broke not the mirror of its billow,\nGlided along the river, and did bend her\n\"Head under the dark boughs, till like a willow\nHer fair hair swept the bosom of the stream\nThat whispered with delight to be their pillow.--\n\"As one enamoured is upborne in dream\nO'er lily-paven lakes mid silver mist\nTo wondrous music, so this shape might seem\n\"Partly to tread the waves with feet which kist\nThe dancing foam, partly to glide along\nThe airs that roughened the moist amethyst,\n\"Or the slant morning beams that fell among\nThe trees, or the soft shadows of the trees;\nAnd her feet ever to the ceaseless song\n\"Of leaves & winds & waves & birds & bees\nAnd falling drops moved in a measure new\nYet sweet, as on the summer evening breeze\n\"Up from the lake a shape of golden dew\nBetween two rocks, athwart the rising moon,\nMoves up the east, where eagle never flew.--\n\"And still her feet, no less than the sweet tune\nTo which they moved, seemed as they moved, to blot\nThe thoughts of him who gazed on them, & soon\n\"All that was seemed as if it had been not,\nAs if the gazer's mind was strewn beneath\nHer feet like embers, & she, thought by thought,\n\"Trampled its fires into the dust of death,\nAs Day upon the threshold of the east\nTreads out the lamps of night, until the breath\n\"Of darkness reillumines even the least\nOf heaven's living eyes--like day she came,\nMaking the night a dream; and ere she ceased\n\"To move, as one between desire and shame\nSuspended, I said--'If, as it doth seem,\nThou comest from the realm without a name,\n\" 'Into this valley of perpetual dream,\nShew whence I came, and where I am, and why--\nPass not away upon the passing stream.'\n\" 'Arise and quench thy thirst,' was her reply,\nAnd as a shut lily, stricken by the wand\nOf dewy morning's vital alchemy,\n\"I rose; and, bending at her sweet command,\nTouched with faint lips the cup she raised,\nAnd suddenly my brain became as sand\n\"Where the first wave had more than half erased\nThe track of deer on desert Labrador,\nWhilst the fierce wolf from which they fled amazed\n\"Leaves his stamp visibly upon the shore\nUntil the second bursts--so on my sight\nBurst a new Vision never seen before.--\n\"And the fair shape waned in the coming light\nAs veil by veil the silent splendour drops\nFrom Lucifer, amid the chrysolite\n\"Of sunrise ere it strike the mountain tops--\nAnd as the presence of that fairest planet\nAlthough unseen is felt by one who hopes\n\"That his day's path may end as he began it\nIn that star's smile, whose light is like the scent\nOf a jonquil when evening breezes fan it,\n\"Or the soft note in which his dear lament\nThe Brescian shepherd breathes, or the caress\nThat turned his weary slumber to content.--\n\"So knew I in that light's severe excess\nThe presence of that shape which on the stream\nMoved, as I moved along the wilderness,\n\"More dimly than a day appearing dream,\nThe ghost of a forgotten form of sleep\nA light from Heaven whose half extinguished beam\n\"Through the sick day in which we wake to weep\nGlimmers, forever sought, forever lost.--\nSo did that shape its obscure tenour keep\n\"Beside my path, as silent as a ghost;\nBut the new Vision, and its cold bright car,\nWith savage music, stunning music, crost\n\"The forest, and as if from some dread war\nTriumphantly returning, the loud million\nFiercely extolled the fortune of her star.--\n\"A moving arch of victory the vermilion\nAnd green & azure plumes of Iris had\nBuilt high over her wind-winged pavilion,\n\"And underneath aetherial glory clad\nThe wilderness, and far before her flew\nThe tempest of the splendour which forbade\nShadow to fall from leaf or stone;--the crew\nSeemed in that light like atomies that dance\nWithin a sunbeam.--Some upon the new\n\"Embroidery of flowers that did enhance\nThe grassy vesture of the desart, played,\nForgetful of the chariot's swift advance;\n\"Others stood gazing till within the shade\nOf the great mountain its light left them dim.--\nOthers outspeeded it, and others made\n\"Circles around it like the clouds that swim\nRound the high moon in a bright sea of air,\nAnd more did follow, with exulting hymn,\n\"The chariot & the captives fettered there,\nBut all like bubbles on an eddying flood\nFell into the same track at last & were\n\"Borne onward.--I among the multitude\nWas swept; me sweetest flowers delayed not long,\nMe not the shadow nor the solitude,\n\"Me not the falling stream's Lethean song,\nMe, not the phantom of that early form\nWhich moved upon its motion,--but among\n\"The thickest billows of the living storm\nI plunged, and bared my bosom to the clime\nOf that cold light, whose airs too soon deform.--\n\"Before the chariot had begun to climb\nThe opposing steep of that mysterious dell,\nBehold a wonder worthy of the rhyme\n\"Of him whom from the lowest depths of Hell\nThrough every Paradise & through all glory\nLove led serene, & who returned to tell\n\"In words of hate & awe the wondrous story\nHow all things are transfigured, except Love;\nFor deaf as is a sea which wrath makes hoary\n\"The world can hear not the sweet notes that move\nThe sphere whose light is melody to lovers---\nA wonder worthy of his rhyme--the grove\n\"Grew dense with shadows to its inmost covers,\nThe earth was grey with phantoms, & the air\nWas peopled with dim forms, as when there hovers\n\"A flock of vampire-bats before the glare\nOf the tropic sun, bring ere evening\nStrange night upon some Indian isle,--thus were\n\"Phantoms diffused around, & some did fling\nShadows of shadows, yet unlike themselves,\nBehind them, some like eaglets on the wing\n\"Were lost in the white blaze, others like elves\nDanced in a thousand unimagined shapes\nUpon the sunny streams & grassy shelves;\n\"And others sate chattering like restless apes\nOn vulgar paws and voluble like fire.\nSome made a cradle of the ermined capes\n\"Of kingly mantles, some upon the tiar\nOf pontiffs sate like vultures, others played\nWithin the crown which girt with empire\n\"A baby's or an idiot's brow, & made\nTheir nests in it; the old anatomies\nSate hatching their bare brood under the shade\n\"Of demon wings, and laughed from their dead eyes\nTo reassume the delegated power\nArrayed in which these worms did monarchize\n\"Who make

glow\n\"Which they extinguished; for like tears, they were\nA veil to those from whose faint lids they rained\nIn drops of sorrow.--I became aware\n\"Of whence those forms proceeded which thus stained\nThe track in which we moved; after brief space\nFrom every form the beauty slowly waned,\n\"From every firmest limb & fairest face\nThe strength & freshness fell like dust, & left\nThe action & the shape without the grace\n\"Of life; the marble brow of youth was cleft\nWith care, and in the eyes where once hope shone\nDesire like a lioness bereft\n\"Of its last cub, glared ere it died; each one\nOf that great crowd sent forth incessantly\nThese shadows, numerous as the dead leaves blown\n\"In Autumn evening from a popular tree--\nEach, like himself & like each other were,\nAt first, but soon distorted, seemed to be\n\"Obscure clouds moulded by the casual air;\nAnd of this stuff the car's creative ray\nWrought all the busy phantoms that were there\n\"As the sun shapes the clouds--thus, on the way\nMask after mask fell from the countenance\nAnd form of all, and long before the day\n\"Was old, the joy which waked like Heaven's glance\nThe sleepers in the oblivious valley, died,\nAnd some grew weary of the ghastly dance\n\"And fell, as I have fallen by the way side,\nThose soonest from whose forms most shadows past\nAnd least of strength & beauty did abide.\"--\n\"Then, what is Life?\" I said . . . the cripple cast\nHis eye upon the car which now had rolled\nOnward, as if that look must be the last,\nAnd answered .... \"Happy those for whom the

O Wind,<br>If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?","bodyPlain":"O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,\nThou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead\nAre driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,\n\nYellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,\nPestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,\nWho chariotest to their dark wintry bed\n\nThe winged seeds, where they lie cold and low,\nEach like a corpse within its grave, until\nThine azure sister of the Spring shall blow\n\nHer clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill\n(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)\nWith living hues and odors plain and hill:\n\nWild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;\nDestroyer and preserver; hear, oh, hear!\n\nII\n\nThou on whose stream, 'mid the steep sky's commotion,\nLoose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed,\nShook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,\n\nAngels of rain and lightning: there are spread\nOn the blue surface of thine aery surge,\nLike the bright hair uplifted from the head\n\nOf some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge\nOf the horizon to the zenith's height,\nThe locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge\n\nOf the dying year, to which this closing night\nWill be the dome of a vast sepulchre,\nVaulted with all thy congregated might\n\nOf vapors, from whose solid atmosphere\nBlack rain, and fire, and hail will burst: oh, hear!\n\nIII\n\nThou who didst waken from his summer dreams\nThe blue Mediterranean, where he lay,\nLulled by the coil of his crystalline streams,\n\nBeside a pumice isle in Baiae's bay,\nAnd saw in sleep old palaces and towers\nQuivering within the wave's intenser day,\n\nAll overgrown with azure moss and flowers\nSo sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou\nFor whose path the Atlantic's level powers\n\nCleave themselves into chasms, while far below\nThe sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear\nThe sapless foliage of the ocean, know\n\nThy voice, and suddenly grow gray with fear,\nAnd tremble and despoil themselves: oh, hear!\n\nIV\n\nIf I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;\nIf I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;\nA wave to pant beneath thy power, and share\n\nThe impulse of thy strength, only less free\nThan thou, O uncontrollable! If even\nI were as in my boyhood, and could be\n\nThe comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,\nAs then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed\nScarce seemed a vision; I would ne'er have striven\n\nAs thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.\nOh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!\nI fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!\n\nA heavy weight of hours has chained and bowed\nOne too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.\n\nV\n\nMake me thy lyre, even as the forest is:\nWhat if my leaves are falling like its own!\nThe tumult of thy mighty harmonies\n\nWill take from both a deep, autumnal tone,\nSweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,\nMy spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!\n\nDrive my dead thoughts over the universe\nLike withered leaves to quicken a new birth!\nAnd, by the incantation of this verse,\n\nScatter, as from an unextinguished hearth\nAshes and sparks, my words among mankind!\nBe through my lips to unawakened earth\n\nThe trumpet of a prophecy!
